# Java Practice: Daily Java Learning

This repository contains my daily Java practice programs, organized day-wise, to strengthen my understanding of Core Java fundamentals through consistent hands-on coding.


## Daily Practice Log

- **Day 01:** Hello World program  
- **Day 02:** Java data types and variables  
- **Day 03:** If-else condition programs  
- **Day 04:** For loop and multiplication table  
- **Day 05:** Palindrome, factorial, even-odd programs  
- **Day 06:** Array programs (max, min, reverse, sum, even-odd count)  
- **Day 07:** String programs (reverse, palindrome, vowel count, word count)  
- **Day 08:** Java methods (parameters, return type, method calling)  
- **Day 09:** OOP basics (class, object, constructor, method calling)  
- **Day 10:** Inheritance (single, multilevel), method overriding, super keyword  
- **Day 11:** Polymorphism (method overloading & method overriding)  
- **Day 12:** Java arrays (declaration, initialization, traversal, basic operations)  
- **Day 13:** Array problems (linear search, second largest element, frequency count, check sorted array, left rotation by one)  
- **Day 14:** 2D array / matrix problems (matrix input-output, sum of elements, transpose, diagonal sum, search in matrix)  
- **Day 15:** String problems (reverse string, palindrome check, vowel-consonant count, remove spaces, word count)

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are to:

- Practice Java programming daily  
- Improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills  
- Build strong fundamentals in Core Java  
- Maintain consistency and discipline in coding  


## Technologies Used

- Java (Core Java)  
- VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA  
- Git & GitHub  


## Note

This repository reflects my daily learning journey.  
Each day focuses on strengthening one or more Java concepts with practical examples and problem-solving practice.
