## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are to practice Java programming daily, improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills, build strong fundamentals in Core Java, gain real-world backend development experience, build production-ready REST APIs using Spring Boot, and maintain consistency and discipline in coding.

## Technologies Used

Java (Core Java)  
Maven  
Spring Boot  
Spring Data JPA  
Hibernate  
Spring Security  
JWT (JSON Web Token)  
MySQL  
Swagger and OpenAPI  
SLF4J and Logback  
Docker  
Docker Compose  
GitHub Actions  
VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA  
Git and GitHub  

## Note

This repository reflects my daily learning journey as a Java Backend Developer.  
Each day focuses on important concepts with hands-on implementation following industry best practices.  
Later days emphasize real-world production-ready backend development including security, monitoring, documentation, scalability, containerization, CI/CD, and deployment readiness.
